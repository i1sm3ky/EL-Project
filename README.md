# EL-Project
A WiFi based online attendance portal, created as my EL (Experiential Learning) class project.

**Project Summary:**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for this project, which was a part of my Experiential Learning (EL) class assessment. Here are the key highlights:

As a proof of concept, this project was created with a minimalistic approach to showcase the feasibility of an improved attendance system.

Working alongside my EL team, we identified several shortcomings in the existing attendance system within my university. These findings prompted us to formulate a problem statement, paving the way for further analysis.

Taking the lead, I spearheaded a local network-based attendance system project that specifically addressed the identified issues. Through our collective efforts, we achieved a significant improvement over the current system, offering enhanced functionality and efficiency.

The development of this innovative attendance solution garnered positive endorsement from professors, reinforcing its potential value. Consequently, I received strong recommendations for the implementation of this system across the university.

Technologies and skills utilized in this project include Python, HTML, CSS, Flask, Problem solving abilities, and Leadership.

Thank you for your interest in this project. Feel free to explore the repository for more details on our approach and the development of this impactful attendance solution.
